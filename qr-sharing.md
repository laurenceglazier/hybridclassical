## 🎯 Tips for Live Events (e.g. Open Studios)

- **Hold your phone steady** so the QR code is easily scannable
- Use **larger phones or tablets** to increase visibility
- Prepare **printed posters** or screens with the QR code if Wi-Fi is strong
- Recommend using **headphones** or low-volume mode in shared spaces
- For group use, choose quieter spaces — some Bluetooth speakers only connect to one device
